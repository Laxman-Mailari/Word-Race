# Word-Race

Word Race is a game designed to improve QWERTY typing rate and efficiency. Words appear one by one at a rate that goes up as time progresses. There is a limited Stack Space that fills up with a certain amount of words. Once a player types a word correctly, that word is removed from stack.

The score is calculated based on how fast the player was able to clear that word. The levelling system is added so that the player can choose the level (easy, medium and hard) . If the stack is empty, itâ€™s game over.
